👋 Hello, I'm SpicyJungle

I'm a 17 year old hobby developer from Norway 🇳🇴.
I primarily use Javascript, and do both backend and frontend with React.

Some of my projects ⤵️
- 🛍️ https://windowshoppr.net - A tool to check the daily shop of video games (So far only supports Fortnite)
- 🐠 https://lingo.fish - A language learning site I built to learn React. I'm working on a re-design at https://lingofish.lol!
- 📖 https://top.gg/bot/817941359041314846 - WikiBot, a discord bot used to pull information from wikipedia and fandom.com. Built in d.js.
