👋 Hello, I'm SpicyJungle

I'm an 18 year old hobby developer from Norway 🇳🇴.
I primarily use Javascript, and do both backend and frontend with React.

Some of my projects ⤵️
- 🎵 [Cloneify](https://cloneify.spicyjungle.dev): A Spotify Clone I built for web dev practice. Built with Next.js and Tailwindcss. Will open-source once finished! 
- 📖 [WikiBot](https://wikibot.gg): A discord bot used to pull information from wikipedia and fandom.com. Built in d.js w/ TS.
- 🍝 [Stellar Recipes](https://stellar.recipes): A site for finding perfect recipes for your needs, such as nutrition, allergies, and flavor preferences.
